## Core Features:

- Intelligent Ticket Analysis: Automatically understand the intent, urgency, and category of incoming support tickets using LLM tool.  This automates the initial assessment process.
- Automated Ticket Routing: Based on the analysis, automatically assign the ticket to the appropriate agent, escalate it if necessary, send an auto-response to acknowledge receipt, or close the ticket if it's resolved.
- Ticket Queue Dashboard: Display a clear view of the ticket queue, showing key information like status, assigned agent, and urgency level. Allow agents to quickly grasp the current workload.
- Agent Decision Logging: Maintain a detailed log of each automated decision, including the reasoning behind it, the actions taken, and any associated data. This is available through the user interface, which makes it easy to track down unexpected behavior.
- Escalation Alerts: Provide real-time alerts when a ticket is escalated due to high urgency or complexity, ensuring prompt human intervention when necessary.
- Human-in-the-Loop Override: Implement an interface where human agents can override the automated decisions, provide feedback on the agent's performance, and correct any errors. Facilitates ongoing agent training and refinement.
